This is a simple batch-replace program. It can load a "dictionary" which is a tab-delimited file ('dic.txt'), read input from 'in.txt' and writes text with replacements to 'out.txt'. These text files are located in the program's directory and are can be rewritten.

This program also can watch clipboard contents and modify it on-the-fly according to the 'dictionary'.
